# MAJIN SUSHI 2
The *long-awaited sequel* to a sushi restaurant game I previously made using plain ol' Vanilla JS and Ruby on Rails while I was attending Flatiron School.

This time around, I'm going to build it with **React/Redux** & **Python/GraphQL** and *completely overhaul* the original game mechanics!
