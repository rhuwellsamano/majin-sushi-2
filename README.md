# MAJIN SUSHI 2
The *long-awaited sequel* to a sushi restaurant game I previously made using plain ol' Vanilla JS and Ruby on Rails while I was attending Flatiron School.

This time around, I'm going to build it with **React/Redux**, **Apollo/GraphQL** and **Python** and *completely overhaul* the original game mechanics!

## DEVLOG
### 10/8/2019
- Created the project repo and README. 
- Going to brainstorm some ideas on how I want it all to flow.
- After a goodnight's sleep, I think I'm going to make it a battle style game where you battle against other cute lookin' food, gain experience, and grow your sushi army!
